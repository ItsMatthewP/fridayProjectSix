## 3. Actionable Recommendations (Example)

Based on the analysis, consider the following:

- **Priority Issue**: Investigate and improve 'Price'. This was the most frequent complaint.
- **Marketing Focus**: Double down on marketing 'Display'. Customers love this feature.
- **Pricing Strategy**: The 'price' is a common negative point. Explore cost-reduction possibilities or emphasize value-for-money in messaging.
- **Ergonomics**: 'Comfort' and 'weight' appear to be concerns. Prioritize R&D for lighter materials and improved weight distribution for the next model.
